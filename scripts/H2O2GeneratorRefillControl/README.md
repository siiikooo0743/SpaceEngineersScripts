# H2O2GeneratorRefillControl
Monitors and controlls the amount of ice in an O2/H2 Generator (Gas Generator).
This is useful, if you want to refill your O2 and H2 Bottles but don't want to add ICE automatically.

To be able to control the flow of ice disable "Use Conveyor System" on the gas generator.
But the gas generator still needs to be connected to an inventory with Ice by a conveyor.

The generator and the container with the ice need to be named. At the top of the script there are variables to set what these names are.
You can also set the amount of ice to keep at all times.

# ReactorControl
Monitors and controlls the amount of uranium in a reactor.
To be able to control the flow of uranium add a conveyor sorter in the conveyor to the reactor.
Also place a sound block somewhere, so the script can warn you if uranium is getting low.

The reactor, sorter and sound block need to be named. The script contains variables to set what these names are.
You can also set the amount of uranium for refill and for alarm there.

## TODO
Make multiple reactors possible.
